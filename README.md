## Welcome!
This GitHub repository contains the source code from Team 5661 Wolves Robotics for the 2023-2024 season game *CENTERSTAGE*

## General Notices
To ease the creation of autonomous paths and programs, I've opted to use &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RoadRunner](https://www.learnroadrunner.com), a popular library for mecanum drive path following kinematics and localization.

## Capabilities
*CENTERSTAGE* demands a lot of any robot. From launching a drone to hanging an entire robot, it ended up being a more complicated build than anticipated and, as a result, a more complicated program.
